# Machine Learning - Classification (Single Label - Multiclass)

This was the final project of my online learning class.
It is about classifying the price range of cellphones which given in the dataset.

There were two datasets involved:
- Training Dataset:
  This is the source of features and label which the model should train and validate on.
- Testing Dataset:
  This is the source of features and label which the model we make should make prediction on.

The final project was held in competition format on Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sanbercode-ds-final-project/overview).
